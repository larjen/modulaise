What does it do?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You put in modules of HTML, JavaScript and CSS, and out comes concatinated
minified CSS, HTML and JavaScript.


### Best practices approach to developing front end code

Using the Modulaise tools suite, you will be creating front end code that 
adheres to the [Web Performance Best Practices][12] rules, as outlined by
Google.


### Modular approach 

Build frontend code using a modular approach thus achieving [seperation][1]
of logic JavaScript, HTML as well as CSS.


### Simplicity

With an [easy to understand modular anatomy][2], you will be constructing your
first site in minutes.


### Reusability of code

Using a flexible yet plain and simple module anatomy allows for a greater
degree of [code reusability][3].


### Maintainable frontend code

By encouraging you to seperate your code into modules, finding and debugging
that troublesome codes becomes easier.


### Coding by convention

Using a [well structured agreed upon project structure][8], makes it easier for
teams to collaborate, since there is never any doubt about where certain
files lives.


### Easy build and deploy cycles

With a strong emphasis on build cycles, the Modulaise tools suite allows 
you to [build and deploy your frontend quickly and continually][4], thus 
empowering you to [release early and release often][5].


### Empowering you to not repeat yourself

Using a simplified template system, and page / pane / module analogy, you
are encouraged to [not repeat yourself while coding][6].


### Easing iterative development

Easing building, deploying and refactoring truly enables you to 
[develop iteratively][7].


<a name="what_not"/>

What is it not?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### It is not a new programming language

You will be writing plain ordinary HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


### It is not a content management system

You will produce static HTML, static JavaScript and static CSS files, the
template system is merely meant and build for you to rapidly prototype
and build frontend code.


### It does not require you to be an elite PHP programmer

At most you will be utilizing 5 - 10 PHP function calls, all of which are
documented and easy to grasp.


### It is not a JavaScript framework

You are absolutely free to pick or omit any JavaScript framework.
